(1) Brief Professional Introduction
Nicole (Hart) Wagoner holds a B.S. in Geological Sciences (Michigan State University) and an M.S. in Geological Sciences (University of Texas at Austin).
She has several years of multidisciplinary technical experience in geological research and applied geology in the energy industry from working at Devon Energy, ConocoPhillips, and Premier Oilfield Group. 
Nicole is currently pursuing her Ph.D. at UNR at the Great Basin Center for Geothermal Energy studying hidden geothermal systems in the Great Basin, USA. 

(2) Goals for this module
1. I would like to expand my programming skills so that I can expand my research capabilities. 
2. I would like to strengthen my Python and Jupyter skills so that I can apply them in my Ph.D. research. 
3. Learn how to use version control with Git so that I can properly manage any code I develop in my research.
4. Learn more about using Matplotlib. My class last semster used Matplotlib but there seems to be much more functionality that we didn't touch on.  
5. Learn how to do geospatial analysis through Geopandas and xArray. The bulk of my research will center on geospatial analysis so this is a very applicable topic for me.
